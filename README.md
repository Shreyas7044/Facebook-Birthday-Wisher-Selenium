# Facebook-Birthday-Wisher-Selenium
Automate posting “Happy Birthday” wishes on Facebook using Selenium WebDriver and Python. This project logs into Facebook, navigates to the birthdays page, detects friends whose birthday is today, and posts an automated birthday message on their timeline. Great example of browser automation using Selenium.
